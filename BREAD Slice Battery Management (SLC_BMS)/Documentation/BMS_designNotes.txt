This slice is made up of two main sections:

Solar Charger: "Adafruit Universal USB / DC / Solar Lithium Ion/Polymer charger" based on bq24074
Boost Converter: Based on MT3608


Solar Charger Changes from Adafruit Design:
	removed output connector and assosiated capacitors
	output goes to input of boost converter
	two capacitors on OUT pin are unpopulated, and are there incase more capacitance is necessary.
	two single-pin headers are for extra capacitor? Part of adafruit design. Removed.
	replaced USB C connector with micro USB connector USB3076-30-A from GCT, footprint in KiCad libraries	
	Status indicating LEDs are driven by arduino, arduino reads status from bq24074 and updates LEDs
	
Boost Converter Notes:
	steps ~4.4V output of solar charger up to 12V and outputs to loaf
	components salvaged from MT3608 converter from amazon, no cheap/suitable options found on DigiKey
	If MT3608 can't be found, any 4V-12V DC-DC converter should work as replacement
	MT3608 footprint in KiCad libraries
	Net "OUT" on boost converter is the input. It's the output of the solar charging chip

	
Arduino pins:
	D5	|	~CHG	|	pulled to GND when battery is charging - use internal pullup on arduino. pinMode(5, INPUT_PULLUP);
	D6	|	~PGOOD	|	pulled to GND when valid power source is connected - use internal pullup
	D7	|	CHGI	|	High when ~CHG is low, used to drive status LED
	D8	|	PGOODI	|	High when ~PGOOD is low, used to drive status LED
	A0	|	ISET	|	Use to monitor actual charging current, see bq24074 datasheet for details
	
Other headers:
	THERM/GND	|	used to connect ntc thermistor on battery pack. Ignore this header unless you need to use it,
					in which case be sure to break connection on solder jumper THERM1
