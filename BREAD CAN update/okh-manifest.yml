title: Broadly Expandable and Reconfigurable Data Acquisition and Automation Device
  (BREAD)
description: "Just as other open source projects have found success by having modular
  frameworks and clearly documented specifications, a framework to unify and
  enable interoperation of these open source electronics systems would be
  greatly beneficial to the scientific community. To meet these needs and ensure
  greater accessibility to high-quality electronics sensing and DAQ systems,
  this article shares and tests a news framework where new open source
  electronics can be developed and have plug-and-play functionality. The Broadly
  Reconfigurable and Expandable Automation Device (BREAD), consists of a basic
  set of guidelines and requirements to which others can contribute. "
